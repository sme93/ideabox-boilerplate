# IdeaBox

## Description

Ever have a billion dollar idea that you're confident you'll remember but end up completely forgetting about, waking up 30 years later wondering what the hell happened? Maybe if you'd had a quick and easy way of jotting that bid idea down, you'd be yachting it up at the French Riviera and Denice wouldn't have left with the kids.

IdeaBox is a utility application that enables users to record and keep track of their hair-brained schemes both large and small. Designed with persistence in mind, IdeaBox utilizes local storage to ensure that your genius idea of opening up a summer camp for cats is never forgotten (ever). 

### Notable features
